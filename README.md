# Coffin
An unfinished shading language written in and inspired by Rust. The goals is to have a modern alternative to languages such as GLSL and HLSL. Currently supports compute shaders and very simple constructs. Compiles to SPIR-V. Features extensive test suite and it's build from the ground up to have good error messages.
